Inspired by the debris from SpaceX's 7th Starship test, Xor created a very inspiring fragment shader that captures the scene quite beautifully. Have a look here:

Inspired by his shader, I wondered what it would be like to finally have starships exploring the strange new worlds that Star Trek made me dream of in my youth. Taking the concepts of the original shader and giving it a positive spin, this shader lets us imagine a scene in a distant part of our galaxy, or wherever, where spaceships are traveling in a group through cosmic clouds or passing a gas giant like Jupiter. I invite you to let your own imagination take you to your favorite alien worlds.
